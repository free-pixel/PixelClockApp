# Contributing to PixelClock

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PixelClock! It's people like you that make PixelClock such a great tool.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.

### Swift Style Guide

- Follow Apple's [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- Use SwiftLint rules (configuration file is in the repo)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
feat: add custom notification sounds

- Implement sound selection interface
- Add built-in notification sounds
- Support custom sound file import

Fixes #123
```
